# reverseEngineering
# Sequelize 

This repo was created as a tutorial to reverse engineer a codebase. We will walk-through and inspect each file's purpose to better understand the code's responsibilities.

We will also cover instructions for how you could add changes to this project.

 
 ## User story:
```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Business Context

When joining a new team, you may be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## Criteria

```md
GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
WHEN I follow the walkthrough
THEN I understand the codebase
```
